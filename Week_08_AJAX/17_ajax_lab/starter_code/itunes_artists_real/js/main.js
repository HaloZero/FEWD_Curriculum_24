// Step 1)
// Take your previous lab solution and copy and paste it here (the Javascript only)
// Get that working! I've removed the example song so make sure your code hasn't broken.
// If you didn't finish the lab, finish it up for Step 1

// Step 2)
// Delete the json provided, the entire variable musicPlaylist
// now instead make an AJAX request to this url: https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=abba
// use the results from the AJAX request.

// Step 3)
// Now the hard part. Instead of doing a request to https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=abba
// I want you to generate the URL for the AJAX request based on the text
// inside the input element on the page.
// So if I type Journey into that input, it should create the url
// https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=journey and do an AJAX request to that URL
