// Step 1)
// Take your previous lab solution and copy and paste it here (the entire Javascript)
// Make sure it works. I've removed the example song so make sure your code didn't change that by accident.

// Step 2)
// Make an AJAX request to this url: https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=abba
// instead of using the json from the prevoius lab musicPlaylist
// use the results from the AJAX to fill in the HTML

// Step 3)
// Now the hard part. Instead of doing a request to https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=abba
// I want you to generate the URL for the AJAX request based on the text
// inside the input element on the page.
// So if I type in Journey into that input, it should create the url
// https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=journey and do an AJAX request to that URL
