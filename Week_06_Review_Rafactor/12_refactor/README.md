###LESSON PLANNING NOTES

Below you will find notes on each section from the proposed schedule above. These notes are  meant to help you plan for a great class.

####Refactoring
_Time : 60min_

*	This section we introduce the term "refactor." The goal is to show students some techniques to keep their code clean. 

#####Refactor

| Code along | [GA Solution File](solution/refactor)|
| :------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 30 min| 
| __Topics__ | refactoring CSS and JS| 
| __Description__| A number of examples the instructor can use to show refactoring techniques for CSS and JS|   
| __Notes__| Use the examples from the file to walk through the different methods of refactoring CSS and JS that are introduced during the slides. Add your own refactor methods.| 


####This Keyword
_Time : 30min_

*	This section introduces students to the keyword "this". This is a basic introduction to scope. 

#####Color Scheme

| Code along | [GA solution file](solution/color_scheme_this) |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 15 min |
| __Topics__ | jQuery, "this" | 
| __Description__| Color scheme switcher examples refactored to use keyword "this" |   
| __Notes__| Starter code is available. This is an  example to show students how to use the keyword "this" | 


####Debug
_Time : 30min_

*	Debugging techniques are valuable for students to have. We've decided to include them here, now that students have a better understanding what is means to develop an application.

#####Debug

| Code along | [GA solution file](solution/debug) |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 15 min |
| __Topics__ | jQuery, "this" | 
| __Description__| Color scheme switcher examples refactored to use keyword "this" |   
| __Notes__| Starter code is available. This is an  example to show students how to use the keyword "this" | 


####Refactor Labs
_Time : 30min_

*	Students put the lesson into practice.

#####Refactor FAQ 

| Exercise| No solution file |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | Remainder Of Class | 
| __Topics__ | "this" Refactor | 
| __Description__| Students practice using the keyword this. |    
| __Notes__| Students should apply debugging and refactoring techniques discussed in the presentation and code alongs. If students are stuck, have them go back to the slides and use the list of methods for refactoring as a jumping off point to get started. | 



#####Refactor Weather Application 

| Exercise| No solution file |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | Remainder Of Class | 
| __Topics__ | "this" Refactor | 
| __Description__| Students practice using the keyword this. |    
| __Notes__| Students should apply debugging and refactoring techniques discussed in the presentation and code alongs to the weather application. |
