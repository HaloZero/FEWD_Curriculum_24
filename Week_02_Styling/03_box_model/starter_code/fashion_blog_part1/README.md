FASHION BLOG PART 1
==================

We'll be working on this site for the next three classes, just a heads up.

For today, we'll be making a simplified version of the site which uses only one column. Your job is to build out the CSS for the page!


Style Guide
-----------

Fonts
-----

-	On this site, we'll be using a font from Google Fonts called Lato. Google "How to use Google Fonts"
	
-	For those that are eager to code: Stick this line of code in your `<head>` *before* your 		usual stylesheet `link`:
			
	<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,700,300italic,700italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>

	In other words, it'll be placed something like, in the `<head>`:

	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Sartreâ€™s List</title>
		<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,700,300italic,700italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">
	</head>
	
-	Once this `link` is there, you'll be able to use lato for your font-family in your CSS.
	The whole page is set in this font (hint hint).

Colors
------

The red color for links is #D00. On hover, they turn to #A00.

There are a slew of grays being used on the page, including (from lightest to darkest):

```
#EEE
#DDD
#CCC
#BBB
#444
```
