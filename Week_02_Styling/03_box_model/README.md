###LESSON PLANNING NOTES

Below you will find notes on each section from the proposed schedule above. These notes are  meant to help you plan for a great class.

####Box Model 
_Time: 50min_

This section is meant to build students understanding of how elements are spaced on the page.

*	Our examples use familiar tags to teach students about box model. We wanted students to only learn box model and not any new tags. In the following example we will show students classes and ids and how the box model applies. 


#####Tags & Boxes

####Selectors & The DOM
_Time: 20min_

*	We use blockquotes and other nested tags to show students how to be more precise with there selectors. Students often struggle with selecting elements on the page that are nested between other tags. 

*	Students find it helpful to draw a DOM tree on the white board.

####Lab Time
_Time: 60min_

*	We've found that students sometimes spend the first 30 min of lab time, pondering what to do first. This lab time we want to help them take those first steps.


|Group Discussion | How To Start |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 10 min | 
| __Topics__ | starting a project | 
| __Description__| Guide students in taking the first steps to building the Fashion blog. |   
|__Notes__| If you were given the fashion blog site part 1, what is the first thing  you would do. The goal here is to teach students that process; how to start.|



| Exercise|[Fashion Blog](solution/fashion_blog_part1)|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 50 min | 
| __Topics__ | html, css, divs, ids, classes | 
| __Description__| Students use the fashion_blog.pdf to recreate the Fashion Blog website. |    
| __Notes__| This lab also test the students ability to be resourceful. They need to look up the article tag. Make that known at the beginning of lab time. |
