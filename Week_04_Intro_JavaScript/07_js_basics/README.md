## [JS Basics](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/kBItz)

###Time: 30 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | getElementById, click event, adding a class, separation of concerns | 
| __Description__| This is a more detailed explanation of JavaScript then the previous class. |   
| __Activity Type__| Code Along | 
 
 
####Instructional Design Notes

*	Last class we taught students how to read JS code. This code along is a slight variation on the color scheme switcher from last week. We want to call students attention to separation of concerns and why its better to change the class instead of css directly in JavaScript. 

*	The goal of this exercise is that it becomes a reference when students want to use a click event and make changes to the DOM through JS.


*	This is the opportunity to discuss syntax (semicolon, brackets rules, etc.) and also further break down how the program is read. 

*	Spend time explaining the click function and how the program waits for the button to be clicked before anything happens. 

*	This is also a good point to describe functions. More on functions next class but this is an opportunity to start the conversation.

## [Score Keeper](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/hAjtq)

###Time: 30 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | data types, variables | 
| __Description__| Bare bones score keeper to explain variables. |   
| __Activity Type__| code along | 
 
 
####Instructional Design Notes

*	Share the HTML and CSS with students so you are only coding the JS. This will save you a lot of time. 

*	Walk through the HTML/CSS code so that the .getElementByID makes sense during your JS code along. 

*	You can change the buttons and functionality to demonstrate other data types. 


##[Compare That](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/BkdqI)

####Time: 30 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | conditionals, variables, text box | 
| __Description__| Visual representation of conditionals, while teaching conditionals |    
| __Activity Type__| Code Along| 


####Instructional Design Notes 

*	Share the HTML and CSS with students so you are only coding the JS. This will save you a lot of time.

##Temp Converter


####Time: 45 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | variables, conditionals, DOM manipulation | 
| __Description__| Students work on this open ended  |    
| __Activity Type__|  Groups and then pairs| 


####Instructional Design Notes 

*	This exercise is fairly open. The HTML/CSS is up to students. There is no HTML or CSS starter code. 

*	To keep things simple, we want students to simply build an application using HTML/CSS and JS that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. 

*	There is no answer key for this exercise (coming soon).
