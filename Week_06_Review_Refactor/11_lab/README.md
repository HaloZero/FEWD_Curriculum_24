##[Memory Game](starter_code/matching)

####Time: 180 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ |  jQuery, each/forEach, events, functions, variables, arguments, classes/ids, using StackOverflow and other resources | 
| __Description__| This lab is your standard memory game. Select two cards, see if they match, and if they don't, turn them back over. |    
| __Activity Type__| Paired Exercise | 


####Instructional Design Notes 

*	Demo the site to students and ask them to recreate the memory game.

*	Students will have the entire class to build the memory game. The goal of this exercise is to divide and conquer. As always, before writing any JS students should have all functionality written out in pseudo code. Some students get lazy and skip the pseudo code. DO NOT LET THEM DO THIS. It will only cause you pain. 

*	They should start by completing the HTML for the game (game container, game cards, reset buttons, etc). Time box this section to 20 min.

*	They should then use CSS to style the game play area. Each card should use a "card" class and when "selected" should have a background image that shows the card as it would appear if turned over. Time box this section to 30 min.

*	Write pseudo code for the application. (Encourage students to work with other paired groups.)
	*	The following functionality should be included in the student's final site: Start game, reset game, 

*	The last step is to code the application in JS.

*	Note that the solution file provides show the refactored version. We do not expect students to code to match the solution. Share the solution at the end of the week so students can use it as a reference.

__BONUS__ For students who would like a more challenging exercise, ask them to complete the following.

*	Use the web to find a function to shuffle the cards. Should you have more advanced students, you can show them how to make a simple jQuery extension that will shuffle any matched elements for a jQuery selector.
	*	For shuffling, students should find a shuffle function online and use it
	*	If you have advanced students, feel free to show them how to write a jQuery extension
	*	source of solution's shufflecards: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-a-javascript-array

*	Track number of moves it took to match all cards

*	Additionally, students who finish early can add a "cheat" mode which shows the match for the currently selected card by making the matching card bigger.

*	Add more cards.
