####Instructional Design Notes

*	Demo the final version before starting the code along.
*	We found it helps to discuss / write the pseudo code for the application before starting to code.
*	Refactor the exercise to use anonymous functions 
	*	Anonymous functions are included because we want students to be able to understand jQuery documentation.
