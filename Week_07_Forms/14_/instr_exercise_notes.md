Remember to share the [starter_code](starter_code/) at the beginning of class. Share code_along solutions before lab time so students have an example to reference. 


###[To_Do_List_App](Link To Starter Code)

####Time: 180 Minutes

|Description|
Students will build a to-do list app.

|Directions|
The instructor will lead the students in a brainstorming exercise to decide what features they want in their app. While this is open ended, the discussion should lead to approximately the same features as the example app. 

Instructor will then lead the students in determining what elements the page needs to contain.

Students will create a simple index page with these elements in it.

Next the instructor should demonstrate how each of the app features should have its own function. To do this, the instructor can discuss APIs or simply help the students name the functions that they will have to write.

Once the API functions are named, instructor can either lead students in writing pseudocode for each function or have the students do this part on their own.

The students should then translate this pseudocode into real code.

Advanced: Discuss localStorage and how you could port this app to a phone using PhoneGap

####Instructional Design Notes 
-Instructor needs to move students towards the same list of features as in the example application
