###Schedule


| Time        | Topic| GA ICLs| Comments |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------------|:----------------|
| 60-80 min | Forms and Inputs Presentation | Forms and Inputs slides | A good place to take a break is right before radio buttons/checkboxes as the students' brains will be pretty well fried. We need fresh brains so that grouping by name makes sense. |
| 15 min | GET requests using forms | COA_Form_Search | Optional |
| 15 min | Validating forms | COA_Form_Validation | Optional |
| 90 min | Building an application form| Application_Form | Students will have to look up textareas and optgroups, this is intentional |
| 00 min | Pseudo-code for To do list | N/A | If you get done early, start the conversation about the to do list app for class 14 |
