LESSON 10: CODE REVIEWS
========

BEFORE CLASS YOU SHOULD
--------
Most lessons will have a running time for each topic, please understand that these times are just suggested estimates and are not strict. 
	
1.	Prior to a each lesson read lessonGuide.md This will outline the main learning objectives for the course,
and will also help you plan and pace yourself during the lesson. 
	
2.	Make sure to become familiar with the ICLs and Homework files. 
You will have to explain homework to students each class and let them know when it will be due.
Let the homework files be your guide as to what is the minimum you should teach. 
Students must be prepared to complete HW on their own.
	
3.	Read the slide deck and insert your content where it prompts you. 
Start to make the lesson your own. Make changes to the slide deck where you see fit. 
If there is an analogy or explanation that doesn't resonate with you, change it.
Add examples or change the ones we provide if you have a better idea. We want you to bring your expertise to the classroom.
	
4.	Post necessary student files to Schoology.

5.	If you made an excellent change, let us know. We like to make sure everyone has the best materials.
