###Week 5 - JS CS Week

This week will be the most difficult. In order to set students up to continue to learn  JavaScript, we need to cover the hard basics. That means variables, conditionals and functions. This week will continue to teach how to add simple interactivity in addition to building the students understanding JavaScript and jQuery. This is also an opportunity to provide a deeper explanation of jQuery.

There is an advance lesson (arrays) if your students move through the materials quickly.

The main project and HW assignment for this week is to create a temperature converter web application that takes a temperature in Celsius and converts it to fahrenheit. This exercise was inspired by a past students exercise: [drakeweathereather.com](http://www.drakeweather.com) Note: that the application does not have to be this advanced.
