##Lesson 10 - Functions 


###LEARNING OBJECTIVES

*	Describe arguments as they relate to functions.
*	Predict values returned by a given function.
*	Differentiate control flow between anonymous and named functions.

###LESSON PLANNING NOTES

Below you will find notes on each section from the proposed schedule above. These notes are  meant to help you plan for a great class.

####Functions
_Time : 60min_

We don't expect students to write functions that return values on their own, at this point.

We want to incrementally build on students understanding of functions. Thus far students understand it as code that alters the flow of control of a program. This section we formally introduce functions including arguments, returns and anonymous. This lesson should add to students understanding of jQuery, and help them better read the docs.
__NOTE__ The top two questions students have about functions are: 

>"When do I use them?"
>"Where do I put Them?"



#####Cash Register

| Code along | [GA Solution File](solutions/cash_register)|
| :------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 30 min| 
| __Topics__ | functions, arguments, returns, anonymous functions  | 
| __Description__| A simple application to help demonstrate functions. This application takes an amount and adds it to a receipt. |   
| __Notes__| We found it helps to discuss / write the pseudo code for the application before starting to code. The solution key for this exercise includes some advanced code. If your students are ready for the leap share the solution code as is. If not, refactor the exercise to something that is more manageable for your students. This application explains return functions. Next lesson we refactor this exercise to use anonymous functions.| 
 
 
#####Anonymous Cash Register

|Code along  | [GA Solution File](solutions/cash_register) |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 30 min | 
| __Topics__ | functions, arguments, returns, anonymous functions  | 
| __Description__| A simple application to help demonstrate anonymous functions. This application takes an amount and adds it to a receipt. |   
| __Notes__| Refactor this exercise to use anonymous functions. It will be important to explain to students why you may use an anonymous function over a named function. |

####Revising jQuery
_Time : 30min_

*	Now that students know more about functions, you can have a more detailed conversation/explanation about jQuery and how it works. In addition you can better explain how to read the jQuery docs. In this section explain document.ready function, and how to use it.

*	This section is open to instructors. This is an opportunity to show students other jQuery functions and events.  


####Weather Application - Part 2
_Time : 60min_

| Exercise | No solution file|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 60 min | 
| __Topics__ | variables, DOM manipulation | 
| __Description__| 3 part exercise. The final version of the Temp Converter will take celsius temperature input convert it to  fahrenheit and change the background image according to the weather. This is the first step in that process|    
| __Notes__| Part 2 students begin to code the application. | 

*	Complete celsius to fareinheit code 
*	Add background changing functionality.


*	Students continue to build their weather application.
