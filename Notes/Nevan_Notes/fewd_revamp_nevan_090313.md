##Lesson 6 Notes: 

We need similar site to traffic light. Together the class will read the code fix what's broken and copy paste update another section that is broken.  This site should show how to keep seperation of concerns while adding JS behavior.

__IDEAS__

*	Theme switcher, change background and text.

*	Team page, img changes when you click a button. 

Pseudo Code
Before explaning programming and computational thinking. Students will get into groups of 4 and write a series of steps to make someone walk. Instructor will provide students with an idea of what this person can already do. Groups will select one person to go to another group and they will act out the code the students wrote.

As a class we need a running example to demonstrate state and flow of control.

__IDEAS__

*	Rock Paper Scissors => best 2 of 3. 
*	Secret Number Game => hard coded number, count how many guesses it took.


##Lesson 7 Notes:

Main topics 
*	Adding Srcipt Tag
*	Functions
*	Variables
*	Returns
*	Conditionals

We will create small sandbox that follow this sequence. 
	*	Lecture -> code along exmaple -> debug exercise

Final lab time project will be to write a small application based on what they've already learned. __NOTE__ Can we add the FAQ site here. We need a how to think piece.

##Lesson 8 Notes:

Main Topics 
*	Practice lesson 7 topics.
*	General jQuery syntax using slide up slide down to demonstrate.
*	Reading jQuery documentation. 
	*	click, double click, 
*	Discuss anonymous functions ( Not using anonymous functions for instructional purposes). 

__Code Demos Ideas__ 

Small medium large text Font size and theme changer 
	Students will lookup how to use add and remove class in jQuery documentation.
	
We need a small lab to get students to begin to think about how to program. Maybe we can use the FAQ site here. Or we can use the Newspaper site.
