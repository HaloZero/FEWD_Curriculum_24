####Instructional Design Notes

*	This is an ambitious site to build in week 3. The goal is to encourage students to divide and conquer. We want to teach them how to look at a png file determine the sections that are needed and then code. 

*	Ask groups to plan and determine where they should start. They should follow the same process you taught them. 

*	For the advanced students, there are 2 additional pages (developers & designers) they can code.

__Please note that students will need to Google:__

*	background-image
*	```<del>``` ```<ins>```
*	overflow
