In this lab, students will build a version of the classic "Hot" or "Not" website. Students can choose whether to use the provided photos of cars and shoes or pull photos from another location.

Students will use an onclick method to navigate between pictures without voting (back and forward).
They will use an an onchange method to give a hotness ranking between 1 and 5. The user should be forwarded to the next image after voting.

The first part of this exercise is TIMED!! 
1) 5 minutes: Box out the exercise from image
2) 10 minutes: Create the HTML for the page from the design
3) 15 minutes: Add the CSS to style the page. Make any needed HTML modifications.
4) The remainder of the time should be used to implement the JS code. 
Topics used: Arrays/array methods, events, variables, functions

Bonus: Create a blocking element (100% height, 100% width, fixed position 0 0) with a "START" button that will hide the page until the button is clicked. Fade out the blocker when the button is clicked to show the underlying page. 

Bonus: After clicking through all the images, display the average hotness score for all GA teachers.
