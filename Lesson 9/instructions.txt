In this lab, you will build a version of the classic Hot or Not website. The first 30 minutes will be spent building the page from the provided image using just HTML/CSS. 


The remainder of the time should be used to implement the following actions:
1) Create an array of the images you wish to use for the game
2) Attach events to the "Skip" and "Back" buttons that will allow the game player to skip an image or go back an image
3) Attach an event to the select field to record when the user votes (think about what action the user would take to vote)
3a) When the user votes, you should record their vote and proceed to the next image
4) When the user reaches the last image display some text that let's the user know they have finished the game.


Bonus: Create a blocking element (100% height, 100% width, fixed position 0 0) with a "START" button that will hide the page until the button is clicked. Fade out the blocker when the button is clicked to show the underlying page. 

Bonus: After clicking through all the images, display the average hotness score for all images.
