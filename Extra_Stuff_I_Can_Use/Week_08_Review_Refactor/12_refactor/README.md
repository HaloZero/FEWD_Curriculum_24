####Instructional Design Notes 

*	Students should apply debugging and refactoring techniques discussed in the presentation and code alongs. 

*	If students are stuck, have them go back to the slides and use the list of methods for refactoring as a jumping off point to get started.

*	They could also refactor divided times.
