###Week 8 - Forms

This week students lean about FORMS. This week offers the possibility to take the course further. If your class is advanced you can discuss GET methods and local storage. 

Lesson 16 is less about forms and more about using forms to build a web application To Do list app. This continues the theme of building in concert. Students build the entire app, from scratch after a class discussion about the features it should have. 

No image for the to do list app.
