###LESSON PLANNING NOTES

Below you will find notes on each section from the proposed schedule above. These notes are  meant to help you plan for a great class.


####Feature Requirements
_Time : 60min_

*	The instructor will lead the students in a brainstorming exercise to decide what features they want in their app. While this is open ended, the discussion should lead to approximately the same features as the example app. (So you don't have to build another solution file, unless you want to).
	
	*	Sample pseudo code you could build with the students can be found [here](solution/pseudocode_suggestions.md).
		
*	Instructors will then lead the students and determine what elements the page needs to contain.

*	Students will create a simple index page with these elements in it.

===

####Lab Session
_Time : 120min_

*	Students take the discussion and code the solution.
