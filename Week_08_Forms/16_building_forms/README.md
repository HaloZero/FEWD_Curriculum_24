##[To_Do_List_App]()

####Time: 180 Minutes

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | | 
| __Description__|Students will build a to-do list app. From pseudo code to HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Exercise is modular and can be taken farther if the class is ready.|    


####Instructional Design Notes
 
*	The instructor will lead the students in a brainstorming exercise to decide what features they want in their app. While this is open ended, the discussion should lead to approximately the same features as the example app. (So you don't have to build another solution file, unless you want to).
	
	*	Sample pseudo code you could build with the students can be found [here](solution/pseudocode_suggestions.md).
		
*	Instructors will then lead the students and determine what elements the page needs to contain.

*	Students will create a simple index page with these elements in it.

*	The students should then translate pseudocode into real code.

*	Advanced: Discuss localStorage and how you could port this app to a phone using PhoneGap
