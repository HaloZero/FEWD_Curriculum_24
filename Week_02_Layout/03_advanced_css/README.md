##[Box Model](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/vtorn)

###Time: 30 min

| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | margin, padding, box model | 
| __Description__| A code example to help explain box model. |   
| __Activity Type__| Code along | 
 

####Instructional Design Notes

*	This code along is in code pen because it is easy to share. When building in class you should use .html and .css files so student become comfortable with using their computer.

*	In this example we use familiar tags to teach students about the box model. 

*	In the following example we will show students classes and ids and how the box model applies. 

*	During the code along check for understanding by asking students "what if" type questions.



##[Nested Selectors](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/gFAfh)


###Time: 20 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | selectors, blockquotes, nesting | 
| __Description__| Students practice selecting elements that are nested. The code pen exercise uses loreum hipster text but you can choose to use another piece of text. |   
| __Activity Type__| Code along.| 
 
 
####Instructional Design Notes

Students often struggle with selecting elements on the page that are nested between other tags. 

*	This code along is in code pen because it is easy to share. When building in class you should use .html and .css files so student become comfortable with using their computer.

*	This code along is used to demonstrate how to select specific elements on the page. Ask student how they would select a specific p tag that is nested in another. They should be able to infer answers based on what they've seen in previous lessons.

*	You can draw a DOM tree on the white board to help with understanding.


##How To Start

###Time: 15 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | starting a project | 
| __Description__| Guide students in taking the first steps to building the Fashion blog. |   
| __Activity Type__| Code along.| 
 
 
####Instructional Design Notes

Students always struggle with how to start. They spend the first 30 min of lab time, pondering what to do first. Help them take those first steps. 

*	If you were given the fashion blog site part 1, what is the first thing  you would do. 

*	Think about that process and how you would teach someone to do the same. 

*	Spend 10 minutes guiding students through that process of where and how students should start the exercise. Direct students by giving them the skills to re create a web page from an image.
