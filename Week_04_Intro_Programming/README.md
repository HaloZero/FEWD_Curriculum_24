###Week 4 Intro To Programming

This week we set the stage for students to create interactive apps. Students will continue to add to their understanding in the following 3 weeks. 

The main project this week is to build a simple accordian style FAQ page. See our curriculum fellows example [here](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/mKzvs).
