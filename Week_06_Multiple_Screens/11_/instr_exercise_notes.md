Remember to share the [starter_code](starter_code/) at the beginning of class. Share code_along solutions before lab time so students have an example to reference. 


###[Memory Game](Link To Starter Code)

####Time: 180 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | jQuery, each/forEach, events, functions, variables, arguments, classes/ids, using StackOverflow and other resources| 
| __Description__| This lab is your standard memory game. Select two cards, see if they match, and if they don't, turn them back over.|    
 
###Directions
Students will have the entire class to build the memory game exercise. They should start by completing the HTML for the game (game container, game cards, reset buttons, etc)
They should then use CSS to style the game play area. Each card should use a "card" class and when "selected" should have a background image that shows the card as it would appear if turned over.

Students should be asked to use the web to find a function to shuffle the cards. However, the instructor may provide students with an example.

The following functionality should be included in the student's final site:
Start game, reset game, number of moves it took to match all cards

Additionally, students who finish early can add a "cheat" mode which shows the match for the currently selected card by making the matching card bigger.

Should you have more advanced students, you can show them how to make a simple jQuery extensions that will shuffle any matched elements for a jQuery selector.
