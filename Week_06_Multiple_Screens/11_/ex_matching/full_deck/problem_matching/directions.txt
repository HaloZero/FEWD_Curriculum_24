Features:
1) 24 cards (12 pairs) to match
2) Reset button, start game button
3) Message that congratulates the gamer when they match all cards and tells them how many moves it took them.

Optional: 
1) Cheat mode (displays the card that matches the currently selected card)

Instructions
1) Open the solution file in your browser and play around with it.
2) Build the HTML page with all the cards
Hint: You'll probably want to have a div that encapsulates all the game related elements (cards, buttons, winner text), each card should have a card class and a class that says what it is (like the Jacks card would have the class "jacks card")
3) Style the cards and game play area
Hint: When a card is "selected" you should show the front of the card. At all other times the back of the card should be showing
4) Write out the pseudo code for defining how the game is played
5) Translate pseudo code into JS

Good luck!
