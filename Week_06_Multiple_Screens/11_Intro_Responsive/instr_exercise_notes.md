<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Learning Objective</th>

    <tr>
    <th>Resources Files</th>
    <td>Boxing_2_IMG, boxing_1_solution</td>
  </tr>
  
 <tr>
    <th>Description</th>
    <td>This exercise has students modify the CSS from their first layout to achieve a different look with the same HTML.</td>
  </tr>
  
     <tr>
    <th>Activity Type</th>
    <td>In-class lab</td>
  </tr>
  
</table>

**Task Instructions**

For the second boxing exercise, have the students open the main css for the first exercise and place a comment at the bottom (something like, /*overwriting CSS for new layout goes here*/). Below this line, have them add CSS that will make their original page look like the Boxing_2_IMG file.
