##Lesson 01 - HTML Basics


###Learning Objectives


*	Establish community in the classroom and create a safe space to ask questions and learn through making mistakes.

*	Recognize the different roles and responsibilities in web development. 

*	Articulate the progression of HTML to HTML5.

*	Apply and experiment with HTML tags ```<html><head><!DOCTYPE html><body><h1><h6>```.

*	Practice using FEWD course tools (sublime text, finder, chrome).


###Schedule


| Time        | Topic| GA ICLs| Comments |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------------|:----------------|
| 60 min |Student Experience | Plan with producers| The first hour of the course will be spent setting expectations and building community in the classroom. |
| 20 min |Intro To Front-End Web Development| | Intro to web development and responsibilities of front-end web developers. From HTML to HTML5 |
| 10 min | Navigating Your Computer | | __Optional__. Recently, we've seen a need to explain how and where to save files on the computer and how to open files using Sublime text. Some students don't know how to navigate their computer.|
| 60 min |HTML Tags & Using Sublime| [GA Press Release]()| Basic site to demonstrate html files and tags. This is another opportunity to show students how to use sublime text. This will make sure everyone is up to speed and ready to move forward.|
| 30 min |Lab Time | [Cookies Recipe]()<br> [Resume]() | Students add tags to a Cookie recipe and start to "markup" their resume. |


###[Homework](../Homework/)

Student facing homework document can be found in the Homework folder (link above). Give students at least one week to complete the homework.

*	__Assignment__: Create a personal website with about me and resume pages.  
*	__Reading__: The Guardian Blog What is front-end development?
*	__Video__: How The Internet Works in 5 minutes [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc)

## [GA Press Release](solution/ga_press_release)

###Time: 20 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | HTML Tags, nesting| 
| __Description__| This is an exercise to show students basic HTML tags.|   
|__Activity Type__| Code Along | 
 
 
####Instructional Design Notes

*	See a [suggestion](solution/ga_press_release/instr_notes.md) of how to implement this code along from our curriculum fellow.


*	Attach meaning to tags and show students how to approach content. 

*	This introductory exercise is meant to highlight HTML tag patterns so students can look up other tags. 

Pattern examples: 

*	It starts with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag.
	*	__Exception__: Only tags which don't need to close are those which contain no nested content? That is, img, input, br, hr, etc (nested content could include text and text according to JS is a node in and of itself).


*	Some tags require an attribute (we will cover img tags next class) 

*	Hierarchy of tags. (H1 is going to be bigger than h2)

*	Tags describe the content. 




Note: Omit ordered list ```<ol>```, students will Google it during lab time.

![Exercise - Instructor](../../img/icons/instr_lab.png)

Remember to share the [starter_code](starter_code/) folder at the beginning of class. Share code_along solutions before lab time so students have an example to reference. 


##[Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe](solution/cookie_recipe)

####Time: 20 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | html tags| 
| __Description__| Students add markup to a chocolate chip cookie recipe. This also serves as a time to practice using web dev tools (sublime, chrome, finder etc)|    
| __Activity Type__| Exercise| 


####Instructional Design Notes 

*	The starter code contains an html file with a recipe for cookies and a png of the final product. Students will add HTML tags to make the page look like the .png. Students are required to google and implement the```<ol>``` tag. Highlight  the ol tag on the .png file ask students to Google how to use it.

*	Bonus: Students can Google and implement the image tag. We will cover image tags next lesson.


##[My Resume](../Homework)

Start Homework

####Time: Remainder Of Class

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | html tags, sublime text, gathering content| 
| __Description__| Students start to write the content for their homework. |    
|__Activity Type__| Exercise | 


####Instructional Design Notes 

*	If time permits, ask students to start homework assignment. First step should be to create the web site folder and the index.html file. Then write plain text for the content and add the markup last.

Note: If you approach building a website differently, please teach students your way. The most important objectives is to give students a process in how to start.
