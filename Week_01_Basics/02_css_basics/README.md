###Time: ~ 60 min total
####3 Part Code Along

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | css, colors, fonts, linking to other pages, ```<style>```,```<img>```, ```<nav>```| 
| __Description__| A working example to demonstrate how css works. |   
| __Activity Type__ | Code Along | 
 
 
####Instructional Design Notes

This code along is used to introduce CSS to students. There is more content about paths, colors and fonts in the slides. We suggest starting with the code along and then reviewing slide content before students begin lab time. Below is our suggestion on how to incrementally build.

Students build the markup during the review exercise.

__Part 1:__ Time: 15 min

*	Review answers to "What Tag is It?" Formally introduce the img tag and (including relative / absolute paths), nav tag.

*	Use this time to show students the file structure of an html file ```<html> /<html>```, ```<body>```, ```<!doctype>```, ```head```, ```meta```, ```title```

*	This is also the time to add to students understanding of the DOM.

	
__Part 2:__ 30 min

*	Style Wendy G. Bites About me page. 

__Part 3:__ 10 min

*	Add a link to the resume page. During lab time, they will add css to style the résumé page. 

*	Remember to create a resume.html file with the students, as this is the first time they will see linking pages. This is also an opportunity to re iterate what was said about absolute and relative paths. Students will take the reigns from there.

![Exercise - Instructor](../../img/icons/instr_lab.png)

Remember to share the [starter_code](starter_code/) folder at the beginning of class. Share code_along solutions before lab time so students have an example to reference. 


##[What Tag Is It?](solution/Wendy_Bite_Solution)

####Time: 20 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | HTML Basics| 
| __Description__| Students write the page markup for Wendy G. Bite's about me page.|    
| __Activity Type__ | Exercise | 


####Instructional Design Notes 

*	Students are provided a png file of the completed website in the starter code folder. Their task is to write markup by identifying what tags to use. 

*	Students are required to google the nav and img tag. Prior to starting the exercise let students know they need to Google ```<nav>``` and ```<img>```. Reassure them that using Google is what you do on a regular basis.

*	We will also discuss HTML page structure.
