This section is meant to show students how to research tags. (```<nav> <img> and <hr>``). In addition to teaching students about HTML structure (Body, Head etc). We supplied a 3 part code along to help communicate these concepts.

There is more content about paths, colors and fonts in the skeloton slides.

####Wendy Bite About Me

| Code Along| [Solution File](solution/Wendy_Bite_Solution) |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | ~60 min| 
| __Topics__ | css, colors, fonts, linking to other pages, ```<style>```,```<img>```, ```<nav>```| 
| __Description__| An example to demonstrate the inner workings of css works. |   
| __Notes__ |  This is a three part code along | 
 

__Part 1:__ 

	Review answers to "What Tag Is It?" Formally introduce the img tag and (including relative / absolute paths), nav tag.

	Use this time to show students the file structure of an html file ```<html> /<html>```, ```<body>```, ```<!doctype>```, ```head```, ```meta```, ```title```

	This is also the time to add to students understanding of the DOM.

	
__Part 2:__ 

	Style Wendy G. Bites About me page. Note that we introduce margin and padding. Next lesson, we will go into more details about the box model.

__Part 3:__

	Add a link to the resume page. During lab time, they will add css to style the résumé page. 

	Remember to create a resume.html file with the students, as this is the first time they will see linking pages. This is also an opportunity to re iterate what was said about absolute and relative paths. Students should complete any necessary styling and html for the resume page.
